##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure Heimdall Database Proxy for Pivotal Greenplum

To install the Heimdall Database Proxy for Pivotal Greenplum installation, do the following:

1. Download the product file from Pivotal Network (heimdall-gp.zip).

1. Upload the install package to either the Greenplum master database node, OR to a separate Linux system (Ubuntu 16.04+ is preferred but others are supported) in /opt.

1. Unzip the heimdall package to /opt/heimdall:

```Bash
sudo unzip heimdall-gp.zip
```

1. Change directory to the heimdall directory:

```Bash
cd /opt/heimdall
```

1. Execute the heimdall installer to setup the system environment:

```Bash
sudo hdinstall.sh
```

1. Verify that port 8087 is being listened on (this is the default management port) with:

```Bash
sudo netstat -alnp | grep 8087.*LIST
tcp6       0      0 :::8087                 :::*                    LISTEN      1577/java
```
    
1. Connect using a browser to the IP of the instance installed on, on port 8087, i.e. http<scan>:</scan>//host:8087/.

1. Review the documentation at http<scan>:</scan>//host:8087/docs/basics/login.html for help in logging into the GUI.

1. Use the wizard to configure the details about your database cluster (select Postgres as the database type for Greenplum).

1. When the wizard is complete, you can use the data source test button and the vdb tester to validate that basic configuration is complete.
